Let's get started!
 
## Step 1: Import and Animate Your Footage and 3D Models
 
The first step is to import your footage and 3D models into After Effects. For this tutorial, we will use a stock video of a boat on the sea and a 3D model of a lighthouse from TurboSquid. You can download them from here[^2^] and here[^3^] respectively.
 
Create a new composition with the same dimensions and frame rate as your footage. Drag your footage to the timeline and trim it to the desired length. Then, create a new solid layer and name it "Psunami". This will be the layer where we will apply the Psunami effect.
 
Next, import your 3D model of the lighthouse into After Effects using File > Import > File. Choose the CINEMA 4D file format and click OK. A new composition will be created with your 3D model inside. You can adjust the position, rotation, and scale of your model using the CINEMA 4D renderer settings in the Effect Controls panel.
 
Once you are happy with your 3D model, drag it to your main composition and place it above the Psunami layer. You can also animate your model using keyframes or expressions if you want.
 
## Step 2: Apply and Adjust the Psunami Effect
 
Now that you have your footage and 3D model ready, it's time to apply the Psunami effect to create the water surface. Select the Psunami layer and go to Effect > Red Giant > Trapcode > Psunami[^1^]. You will see a flat blue plane covering your footage.
 
To make it look more like water, you need to adjust some parameters in the Effect Controls panel. Here are some suggested settings:
