## Step 1: Find a Guild Emblem
 
The first step is to find a guild emblem that you like. There are many websites that offer free guild emblems for Ragnarok Online, such as DeviantArt[^1^], rAthena[^2^] and rAthena Board[^3^]. You can browse through their collections and choose one that suits your guild's theme and style. Alternatively, you can use an image editing software like Photoshop or GIMP to create your own emblem from scratch.
 
## Step 2: Download the Guild Emblem
 
Once you have found a guild emblem that you want to use, you need to download it to your computer. Most guild emblems are in .bmp format and have a size of 24x24 pixels. To download a guild emblem from a website, simply right-click on the image and select "Save Image As" or "Save Link As". Choose a location where you want to save the file and name it as "emblem.bmp". Make sure that the file extension is .bmp and not .gif or .png.
 
## Step 3: Install the Guild Emblem
 
The final step is to install the guild emblem in your Ragnarok Online folder. To do this, you need to locate the "Emblem" folder inside your Ragnarok Online directory. This is usually located at C:\Program Files\Gravity\RagnarokOnline\Emblem or C:\Program Files (x86)\Gravity\RagnarokOnline\Emblem. If you don't have an Emblem folder, you can create one yourself. Then, copy and paste the emblem.bmp file that you downloaded into the Emblem folder. You can also rename the file if you want to have more than one emblem.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy Your New Guild Emblem
 
Now that you have installed your new guild emblem, you can enjoy it in the game. To change your guild emblem, you need to be the guild master or have the permission to do so. Then, open the Guild window by pressing Alt+G or clicking on the Guild icon on the menu bar. Click on the "Edit" button next to the current emblem and select "Change Emblem". A window will pop up with all the emblems that you have in your Emblem folder. Choose the one that you want to use and click "OK". Your new guild emblem will be updated immediately.
 
Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded and installed a Ragnarok guild emblem. You can now show off your guild's identity and pride with your unique emblem. Have fun playing Ragnarok Online!
