If you want to read and understand Surah Baqarah in Arabic, you can download a PDF file of its text from various online sources. However, before you do that, you should be aware of some important points:
  
- Surah Baqarah is written in Arabic with the narration of Hafs on Asim, which is one of the ten accepted recitations of the Quran. This means that there may be slight variations in pronunciation, spelling, and diacritical marks from other recitations.
- Surah Baqarah is divided into 40 sections (ruku) and 20 quarters (hizb). Each section has a number and a name that indicates its main theme. For example, section 1 is called "The Opening" and section 2 is called "The Cow". Each quarter has a symbol that marks its end. For example, quarter 1 ends with a symbol that looks like a small letter "jeem".
- Surah Baqarah contains many verses that are abrogated (naskh) by later verses or by the Sunnah (the teachings and actions of Prophet Muhammad). This means that some rulings or commands in Surah Baqarah are no longer valid or applicable for Muslims today. For example, verse 106 says: "We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is over all things competent?"
- Surah Baqarah contains many verses that are general (aam) or specific (khaas), absolute (mutlaq) or conditional (muqayyad), literal (haqiqi) or metaphorical (majazi), clear (muhkam) or ambiguous (mutashabih), and so on. These distinctions affect how the verses should be interpreted and applied. For example, verse 256 says: "There is no compulsion in religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong." This verse is general and absolute, meaning that it applies to all people and situations. However, some scholars have argued that it is specific and conditional, meaning that it applies only to certain people and situations.

Therefore, if you want to read and understand Surah Baqarah in Arabic, you should not rely on the PDF file alone. You should also consult reliable sources of tafsir (exegesis), such as books, websites, or scholars, that explain the meaning, context, and implications of each verse. You should also compare different translations and interpretations to get a better understanding of Surah Baqarah.
  
Surah Baqarah is a rich and comprehensive chapter of the Quran that contains many lessons and benefits for Muslims. By reading and understanding it in Arabic, you can increase your knowledge, faith, and guidance.
