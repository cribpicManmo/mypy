Process Systems Analysis and Control is a textbook that covers the fundamental concepts and techniques of process dynamics and control. It is designed for a semester-long undergraduate chemical engineering course in this topic. The book is well known for its clarity of presentation and its avoidance of the encyclopedic approach of many other texts on this topic.
 
The third edition of the book has been updated to include new topics, such as model predictive control and digital control, that are introduced at a level appropriate for the undergraduate chemical engineering curriculum. The book also features computer examples using MATLAB and Simulink throughout the chapters to supplement and enhance standard hand-solved examples. These packages allow the easy construction of block diagrams and quick analysis of control concepts to enable the student to explore "what-if" type problems that would be much more difficult and time consuming by hand.
