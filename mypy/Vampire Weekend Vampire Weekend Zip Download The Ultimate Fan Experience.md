Vampire Weekend was formed in 2006 by four college friends: Ezra Koenig (lead vocals, guitar), Rostam Batmanglij (keyboards, guitar, vocals), Chris Tomson (drums), and Chris Baio (bass). They met at Columbia University and started playing music together in their dorm rooms. They named themselves after a short film that Koenig made during his freshman year.
 
The band recorded their debut album in various locations around New York City, including their apartments, a barn, and a studio. They self-produced the album and released it independently on January 29, 2008. The album received critical acclaim and commercial success, reaching number 17 on the Billboard 200 chart and selling over half a million copies in the US. It was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2009.
 
The album's sound is influenced by various genres and cultures, such as African music, Western classical music, punk rock, and reggae. The lyrics are witty and clever, often referencing literary works, historical figures, and obscure topics.
