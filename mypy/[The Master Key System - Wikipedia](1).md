## How to Draw Basic Shapes in AutoCAD 2006
 
One of the most common tasks in AutoCAD 2006 is to draw basic shapes, such as lines, circles, rectangles, polygons, etc. You can use the Draw menu or the Draw toolbar to access the commands for drawing these shapes. You can also use the command line or the shortcut keys to enter the commands directly.
 
For example, to draw a line, you can use the LINE command. You can enter LINE on the command line or press L on the keyboard. You can also click the Line button on the Draw toolbar or select Line from the Draw menu. Then, you can specify the start point and the end point of the line by clicking on the screen or entering coordinates. You can press Enter or Esc to end the command.
 
To draw a circle, you can use the CIRCLE command. You can enter CIRCLE on the command line or press C on the keyboard. You can also click the Circle button on the Draw toolbar or select Circle from the Draw menu. Then, you can specify the center point and the radius of the circle by clicking on the screen or entering values. You can press Enter or Esc to end the command.
 
To draw a rectangle, you can use the RECTANG command. You can enter RECTANG on the command line or press REC on the keyboard. You can also click the Rectangle button on the Draw toolbar or select Rectangle from the Draw menu. Then, you can specify the first corner and the second corner of the rectangle by clicking on the screen or entering coordinates. You can press Enter or Esc to end the command.
 
To draw a polygon, you can use the POLYGON command. You can enter POLYGON on the command line or press POL on the keyboard. You can also click the Polygon button on the Draw toolbar or select Polygon from the Draw menu. Then, you can specify the number of sides and the center point of the polygon by clicking on the screen or entering values. You can also specify whether you want to draw an inscribed or a circumscribed polygon. You can press Enter or Esc to end the command.
 
These are some of the basic commands for drawing shapes in AutoCAD 2006. You can use these commands to create simple drawings or to start more complex drawings.
