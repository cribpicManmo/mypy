## Factors Affecting Jantri Rates
 
Jantri rates are based on several factors, such as:
 
- The location of the property, such as urban or rural area, proximity to roads, markets, etc.
- The type of property, such as residential or commercial, agricultural or non-agricultural, etc.
- The size of the property, such as plot area, built-up area, carpet area, etc.
- The age and condition of the property, such as new or old construction, quality of materials used, etc.
- The demand and supply of the property in the market.

Jantri rates are revised every five years by the Revenue Department based on these factors. The last revision was done in 2011 and the current rates are effective from April 1, 2011. However, due to various reasons, such as inflation, market fluctuations, development projects, etc., Jantri rates may not reflect the actual market value of the property. Therefore, it is advisable to consult a professional valuer or a real estate agent before buying or selling a property.
 
## How to Calculate Jantri Rates
 
Jantri rates are calculated per square meter of land or built-up area. The formula for calculating Jantri rates is as follows:
 
**Jantri rate = Base rate x Use factor x Type factor x Construction factor x Floor factor x Age factor**
 
The base rate is the basic rate of land or property in a given area. It varies according to the zone classification of the area, such as A (prime), B (high), C (medium), D (low), E (very low), etc.
 
The use factor is a multiplier that depends on the use of the property, such as residential or commercial, agricultural or non-agricultural, etc. It ranges from 0.5 to 4.

The type factor is a multiplier that depends on the type of property, such as independent house or flat, shop or office, etc. It ranges from 0.5 to 2.
 
The construction factor is a multiplier that depends on the quality of construction of the property, such as RCC or load bearing structure, marble or mosaic flooring, etc. It ranges from 0.5 to 2.
 
The floor factor is a multiplier that depends on the floor level of the property, such as ground floor or upper floor. It ranges from 0.8 to 1.2.
 
The age factor is a multiplier that depends on the age of the property. It ranges from 0.5 to 1.
 
For example, if you want to calculate the Jantri rate of a residential flat of 100 sq.m. built-up area on the first floor with RCC structure and mosaic flooring in zone B in Ahmedabad city with a base rate of Rs. 20,000 per sq.m., then:
 
**Jantri rate = Rs. 20,000 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 0.9 = Rs. 18,000 per sq.m.**
