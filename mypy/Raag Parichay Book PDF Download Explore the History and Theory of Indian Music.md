Indian classical music is one of the oldest and most diverse musical traditions in the world. It has evolved over thousands of years and has been influenced by various cultures and regions. It is based on a system of ragas, which are melodic frameworks that evoke different emotions and moods. Each raga has its own rules and characteristics, such as the time of day, the season, the scale, the notes, the ornaments and the movements.
 
Indian classical music is also based on a system of talas, which are rhythmic cycles that govern the tempo and structure of the music. Each tala has its own number of beats and subdivisions, as well as specific patterns and accents. The combination of raga and tala creates a complex and dynamic musical expression that can range from serene and meditative to lively and energetic.

Indian classical music is performed by vocalists or instrumentalists who use their voice or instruments to create melodies and improvisations within the raga and tala framework. The most common instruments used in Indian classical music are the sitar, the sarod, the bansuri, the tabla, the harmonium and the tanpura. The music is usually accompanied by a drone that provides a constant pitch reference for the performers.
