# Arrow - Season 2 - 720p BluRay - x264 - 24: A Review
 
If you are a fan of the DC Comics superhero Green Arrow, you might want to check out the second season of Arrow, the TV series that follows his origin story and adventures. The season consists of 24 episodes, each with a runtime of about 42 minutes, and is available in high-definition 720p BluRay format with x264 encoding.
 
The season picks up where the first one left off, with Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) returning to Starling City after failing to stop his archenemy Malcolm Merlyn (John Barrowman) from destroying the Glades, a poor neighborhood in the city. Oliver has to deal with the consequences of his actions, both as a vigilante and as a billionaire playboy. He also faces new threats, such as the mysterious League of Assassins led by Ra's al Ghul (Matt Nable), the ruthless mercenary Slade Wilson (Manu Bennett), who has a personal vendetta against him, and the cunning hacker Felicity Smoak (Emily Bett Rickards), who becomes his ally and love interest.
