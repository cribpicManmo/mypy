If you have an Icom radio and you want to know when it was made, you might be interested in finding out its serial number. The serial number is a unique identifier that can help you determine the year of manufacture of your radio. However, not all Icom radios have serial numbers that are easy to decode. Here are some tips on how to find out the year of manufacture of an Icom radio by its serial number.
 
## Check the Model Number
 
The first thing you need to do is to check the model number of your radio. Different models may have different serial number formats. For example, according to some sources[^1^] [^2^], Icom stopped encoding the date of manufacture in the serial number for some models a few years ago. In that case, the serial number only identifies the product and does not contain any information about the year of manufacture. Some examples of such models are IC-910H and IC-R8500[^1^] [^3^].

## Check the Region Code
 
If your radio model has a serial number that encodes the date of manufacture, you need to check the region code. The region code is usually the second digit of the serial number and it indicates where the radio was sold. Different regions may have different serial number formats. For example, according to some sources[^4^], the original series used 0 as the first digit, the second digit was the region code and the rest was sequential. The region codes are as follows:
 
- 0: Japan
- 1: USA
- 2: Canada
- 3: Australia/New Zealand
- 4: Europe
- 5: Asia (except Japan)
- 6: South America
- 7: Africa
- 8: Other countries

## Check the Date Code
 
If your radio model and region code have a serial number that encodes the date of manufacture, you need to check the date code. The date code is usually a combination of letters and numbers that indicate the year and month of manufacture. Different models and regions may have different date code formats. For example, according to some sources[^4^], some models used a letter for the year and a number for the month, such as A1 for January 1980, B2 for February 1981, C3 for March 1982, etc. Other models used a number for the year and a letter for the month, such as 1A for January 1991, 2B for February 1992, 3C for March 1993, etc.
 
## Contact Icom
 
If you cannot find out the year of manufacture of your radio by its serial number using the above methods, you can try contacting Icom directly. Icom may have more information about their products and their serial numbers than what is available online. You can contact Icom by phone or email using their contact details on their website. You will need to provide them with your radio model and serial number and ask them politely for the year of manufacture.

## Why Knowing the Year of Manufacture Matters
 
Knowing the year of manufacture of your radio can be useful for several reasons. For example, you may want to know how old your radio is and how long it will last. You may also want to know if your radio has any features or updates that newer or older models do not have. You may also want to know if your radio is compatible with other devices or accessories that you want to use with it. Knowing the year of manufacture can help you make informed decisions about your radio and its maintenance.
