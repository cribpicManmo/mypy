Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was one of the most influential and celebrated singers of the 20th century. His voice transcended boundaries of language, culture and religion, and touched the hearts of millions around the world. He was a master of qawwali, a form of devotional music that originated in the Sufi tradition of Islam. Qawwali is characterized by passionate vocals, rhythmic percussion, harmonium accompaniment and poetic lyrics that express love for God and his prophets.
 
In 2008, Sony BMG Music Entertainment and Navras Records released a four-CD box set titled Reverence, which features some of Nusrat's finest performances of traditional Sufi qawwalis. The recordings were made live at the Kufa Gallery in London on December 14th, 1989, and capture the intensity and spontaneity of Nusrat's artistry. The box set includes a total of 12 tracks, each ranging from 15 to 40 minutes in length, and covering various ragas (melodic modes) and themes. The songs are sung in Urdu, Farsi, Hindi and Punjabi, and are based on the works of famous Sufi poets such as Amir Khusrau, Allama Iqbal and Baba Bulleh Shah.
