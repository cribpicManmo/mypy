## Plot
 
The film begins with wildlife photographer Venkat Ramakrishnan (Srikanth) receiving a call from his college mate Srivatsan (Sathyan), who claims to know the whereabouts of their long-lost friend Panchavan "Pari" Pariventhan (Vijay). Venkat meets up with another friend, Sevarkodi Senthil (Jiiva), and they set out to find Pari in Ooty.
 
Through flashbacks, it is revealed that Venkat, Senthil and Pari were roommates at Ideal Engineering College (IEC) in Chennai. While Venkat and Senthil were average students who studied engineering under pressure from their families, Pari was a brilliant and carefree student who loved learning for its own sake. He often clashed with the college director Dr. Virumandi "Virus" Santhanam (Sathyaraj), who believed in rote learning and strict discipline. Pari also fell in love with Virus' daughter Ria (Ileana D'Cruz), a medical student.
 
Pari inspired Venkat and Senthil to follow their dreams and not succumb to societal expectations. He helped Venkat pursue his passion for wildlife photography, Senthil overcome his fear of failure and poverty, and Ria break free from her father's control. He also exposed the corruption and malpractices of Virus and his favorite student Srivatsan, who was nicknamed "Silencer" for his annoying habit of farting.

However, on the day of their graduation, Pari disappeared without a trace, leaving behind only his engineering project, a scooter that ran on compressed air. Venkat and Senthil were heartbroken by his absence and lost contact with him over the years.
 
Back in the present, Venkat, Senthil and Srivatsan reach Ooty and find Pari's house. They are shocked to see that Pari has become a wealthy inventor and entrepreneur, who owns several patents and runs a company called Pari's Innovation. They also learn that he is married to Ria and has a son named Kosaksi Pasapugazh (Santhanam).
 
Pari welcomes his old friends warmly and tells them his story. After leaving college, he went to Delhi and worked as a scientist at an organization called CECRI. He invented many devices that benefited society, such as a low-cost sanitary napkin machine, a wireless electrocardiograph, and a baby warmer. He also reunited with Ria, who had left her father's house to become an independent doctor.
 
Pari then invites Venkat and Senthil to attend his son's school function, where he is the chief guest. There, he gives a speech about the importance of creativity and innovation in education, and criticizes the current system of rote learning and marks-based evaluation. He also reveals that he had hacked into Virus' computer and changed his own grades from Fs to As before leaving college.
 
Virus, who had come to Ooty to attend his daughter's wedding anniversary, hears Pari's speech and confronts him angrily. He accuses Pari of cheating and ruining his reputation. He challenges Pari to prove his intelligence by answering a difficult question on astrophysics. Pari accepts the challenge and answers the question correctly using his common sense and logic.
