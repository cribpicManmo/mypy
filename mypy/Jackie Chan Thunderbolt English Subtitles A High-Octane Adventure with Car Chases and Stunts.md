## What Critics Say About Thunderbolt
 
Thunderbolt received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Chan's action scenes but criticized the weak plot, dialogue, and acting. The movie has a 6.3/10 rating on IMDb[^3^] and a 50% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Some of the positive reviews include:

> "This is another action-packed movie starring Jackie Chan, where he plays expert mechanic Chan Foh To who runs a small business in Hong Kong with his father and two sisters...The movie features thrilling car chases, stunts, and fights that showcase Chan's skills and charisma." - bob the moo, IMDb user[^2^]

> "Thunderbolt was one of Chan's best films because 'it pursues the action aesthetic all the way, never pausing long enough for dramatic frills' like some of the star's other works." - Stephen Teo, Hong Kong Film Critics Society[^3^]

Some of the negative reviews include:

> "Thunderbolt is a disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promise of high-octane action and comedy. The plot is thin and nonsensical, the dialogue is cheesy and clichÃ©d, and the acting is wooden and hammy. The only saving grace is Jackie Chan's stunt work, which is impressive but not enough to make this film worth watching." - James Berardinelli, ReelViews

> "Thunderbolt is a bland and boring affair that wastes Jackie Chan's talents and charisma. The movie tries to be a serious thriller but ends up being a dull and predictable mess. The car racing scenes are poorly filmed and edited, the fight scenes are few and far between, and the villain is laughable and annoying. Thunderbolt is a thundering flop." - Richard Harrington, Washington Post

## Why You Should Watch Thunderbolt Anyway
 
Despite the mixed reviews, Thunderbolt is still worth watching for Jackie Chan fans and action lovers. The movie showcases some of Chan's most daring and dangerous stunts, such as jumping from a helicopter onto a moving car, fighting on top of a giant ferris wheel, and racing against a bullet train. The movie also features some of Chan's trademark humor and charm, such as his interactions with his family, his love interest, and his coach.
 
Thunderbolt is also a rare opportunity to see Chan in a different role than his usual comedic cop or martial artist. In this movie, he plays a mechanic and racer who has to use his skills and wits to survive against a ruthless enemy. He also gets to drive some cool cars, such as a Mitsubishi GTO, a Nissan Skyline GT-R, and a Porsche 911 Turbo.
 
Thunderbolt is not a perfect movie, but it is an entertaining one that will keep you engaged and amazed by Jackie Chan's abilities. If you are looking for a fun and exciting movie to watch with English subtitles, you should give Thunderbolt a try.
