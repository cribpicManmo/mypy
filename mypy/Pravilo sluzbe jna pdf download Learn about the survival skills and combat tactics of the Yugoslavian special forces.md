# Pravilo Sluzbe JNA: A Guide to the Service Rules of the Yugoslav People's Army
 
The Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) was the military force of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1945 to 1992. It was composed of six republics: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia. The JNA had a complex and diverse structure, with various branches, units and institutions. To ensure the proper functioning and discipline of the JNA, a set of service rules was established and updated over the years.
 
The service rules of the JNA covered various aspects of the military life, such as: basic provisions, basic rights and duties of military personnel, relations in the JNA, units in barracks, daily life and routines, internal function of institutions and command, mechanized units, logistic units, aviation units and institutions, health care, maintenance of technical resources, looking after livestock, parades, reviews inspections, recruits, travel, garrison, sentries, levels of alert, military festivals celebrations and honours, mourning and discipline.

Here are some more paragraphs for the article:
 
The JNA was involved in several conflicts and crises during its existence. The most notable ones were:

- The Informbiro period (1948â1955): This was a period of political and ideological confrontation between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, after Tito refused to submit to Stalin's authority. The JNA faced a threat of a Soviet invasion and underwent a purge of pro-Soviet elements. The JNA also supported the Greek communists in the Greek Civil War and clashed with NATO forces in the Trieste crisis. [10]
- The Croatian Spring (1970â1971): This was a mass movement of Croatian nationalists and reformists who demanded more autonomy and rights for Croatia within Yugoslavia. The JNA intervened to suppress the movement and arrested its leaders. The JNA also clashed with Croatian emigrant groups who staged terrorist attacks against Yugoslav targets. [11]
- The Kosovo crisis (1981â1989): This was a series of protests and riots by the Albanian majority in Kosovo, who demanded more autonomy and recognition of their national identity within Yugoslavia. The JNA was deployed to restore order and quell the unrest, often using excessive force and violating human rights. The JNA also faced armed resistance from Albanian separatist groups. [12]
- The Slovenian War of Independence (1991): This was a brief armed conflict that followed Slovenia's declaration of independence from Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991. The JNA attempted to prevent Slovenia's secession by seizing its border posts and airports, but faced strong resistance from the Slovenian Territorial Defence and police. The war ended with the Brioni Agreement, which stipulated the withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia and a three-month moratorium on Slovenia's independence. [13]
- The Croatian War of Independence (1991â1995): This was a prolonged armed conflict that followed Croatia's declaration of independence from Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991. The JNA initially tried to keep Yugoslavia intact by occupying parts of Croatia where Serbs formed a majority or a significant minority, but later sided with the rebel Serbs who proclaimed their own republics within Croatia. The JNA fought against the Croatian forces and their allies, such as the Bosnian Croats and NATO. The war ended with the Dayton Agreement, which recognized Croatia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, but also granted autonomy to the Serb-held areas. [14]
- The Bosnian War (1992â1995): This was a complex and brutal armed conflict that followed Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of independence from Yugoslavia on 3 March 1992. The JNA officially withdrew from Bosnia and Herzegovina in May 1992, but many of its personnel remained there as part of the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS), which fought against the Bosnian government forces and their allies, such as the Bosnian Croats and NATO. The JNA also supported the Army of the Serb Republic of Krajina (SVK), which fought against Croatia in western Bosnia. The war ended with the Dayton Agreement, which recognized Bosnia and Herzegovina's sovereignty and territorial integrity, but also divided it into two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. [15]

The JNA was formally dissolved on 20 May 1992, when the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) was proclaimed as the successor state of SFR Yugoslavia. The remaining JNA forces were reorganized into the new Yugoslav Army (VJ), which inherited most of the JNA's equipment and personnel. The VJ continued to be involved in conflicts in Kosovo (1998â1999) and Macedonia (2001), until it was reformed into the Serbian Armed Forces (VS) in 2006, after Montenegro declared its independence from FRY.
