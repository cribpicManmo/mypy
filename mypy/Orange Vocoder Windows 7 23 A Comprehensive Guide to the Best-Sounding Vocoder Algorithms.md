- A total of 24 unique vocoding algorithms based on techniques including analog modeling, speech modeling, independent component analysis, LPC filtering, wavelet transforms, and more.
- A completely rewritten, high quality synthesizer section including Unison and Mono Legato operation, thru-zero linear FM, comprehensive modulation options, a preset generator, and more.
- A new MIDI-controlled pitch quantizer module featuring 5 modes, including the brand-new zero-latency pitch enforcer, with grain morphing and optionally polyphonic operation.
- A new filter-bank freezing feature that allows you to capture and manipulate the spectral content of any sound source.
- A new reverb module that adds depth and dimension to your vocoded sounds.

Orange Vocoder IV is easy to use and flexible. You can choose from 8 different sound modes, each with its own character and sonic possibilities. You can also adjust the formant shifting, expansion, and stereo operation of the vocoder section. You can use any input source or audio track as the carrier signal, and any audio track as the modulator. You can also use the built-in oscillator as the carrier signal, which offers 10 basic waveforms and 7 sampled sounds. You can control the pitch, detune, filter, FM, sync, and ring modulation of the oscillator with the synthesizer section.
 
Orange Vocoder IV also lets you create pitch effects with the pitch quantizer module. You can use MIDI notes to control the pitch of the vocoded signal, or use one of the 5 modes to create different effects. The zero-latency pitch enforcer mode is especially useful for correcting pitch errors or creating harmonies. You can also morph between different grains of the vocoded signal to create smooth transitions or glitches. The pitch quantizer module can operate in monophonic or polyphonic mode, depending on your preference.
 
Orange Vocoder IV also has a filter-bank freezing feature that allows you to capture and manipulate the spectral content of any sound source. You can freeze the filter-bank at any moment and play it back like a sampler. You can also modulate the filter-bank with an LFO or an envelope follower to create dynamic variations. The filter-bank freezing feature is great for creating drones, pads, textures, and soundscapes.
 
Orange Vocoder IV also has a reverb module that adds depth and dimension to your vocoded sounds. You can adjust the mix, decay, and density of the reverb to suit your taste. The reverb module also has a freeze button that lets you hold the reverb tail indefinitely. The reverb module is perfect for adding space and ambience to your vocoded sounds.
