# How to Download Discrete-Event System Simulation by Jerry Banks and Others
 
Discrete-event system simulation is a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing complex systems in engineering, business, or computer science. It can help you understand the behavior and performance of systems, test different scenarios, and optimize your decisions. But how can you get access to this valuable resource?
 
One way is to buy the book Discrete-Event System Simulation by Jerry Banks and others, which is considered one of the best textbooks on the subject. It covers the principles of modeling and analysis that apply to any simulation software, as well as specific applications in manufacturing, material handling, computer systems, and computer networks. It also provides examples, exercises, solutions, and simulation source code for download. The book is available in print or ebook format from various online retailers.

Another way is to download the ebook for free from some websites that offer it without permission from the authors or publishers. This is illegal and unethical, and it may expose you to malware or viruses. Moreover, you may not get the latest edition of the book, which has been updated and revised several times since its first publication in 1996. The current edition is the fifth one, published in 2010 by Pearson Education.
 
Therefore, we recommend that you buy the book legally from a reputable source, or borrow it from a library if possible. This way, you will support the authors and publishers who have invested their time and effort in creating this valuable resource. You will also get the most accurate and reliable information on discrete-event system simulation.
 
If you are interested in learning more about discrete-event system simulation and its applications, you can visit the website of the book at www.bcnn.net/, where you can find additional resources such as web links, errata, and simulation source code for download[^1^] [^2^]. You can also read some reviews of the book from other readers at Google Books[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].

## Some Applications of Discrete-Event System Simulation in Health Care
 
Discrete-event system simulation can be used to model and analyze various aspects of health care systems, such as service delivery, resource allocation, patient flow, disease progression, screening programs, and health behavior. By simulating different scenarios and comparing their outcomes, discrete-event system simulation can help health care managers and policy makers improve the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care services.

According to a systematic review of discrete-event system simulation applications in health care published in 2018, the applications were distributed unevenly into four major classes: health and care systems operation (HCSO), disease progression modeling (DPM), screening modeling (SM), and health behavior modeling (HBM). The review found that more than 68% of HCSO by discrete-event system simulation were focused on specific problems in individual units, such as emergency departments, operating rooms, intensive care units, outpatient clinics, and pharmacies. The review also identified some common challenges and limitations of discrete-event system simulation in health care, such as data availability and quality, model validation and verification, stakeholder involvement and communication, and model implementation and dissemination.
 
In this article, we will briefly introduce some examples of discrete-event system simulation applications in each of the four classes mentioned above. We will also discuss some of the benefits and challenges of using discrete-event system simulation in health care.
